# spotting-violence-in-news-nlp
This project uses a simple NLP supervised learning pipeline to identify several types of violence reports in news items.

The jupyter code provided in this repository provides insights into the machine learning part of the article "How Big is the Media Multiplier? Evidence from
Dyadic News Data" by Tim Besley, Thiemo Fetzer and Hannes Mueller. Please cite the paper if you use the code.

A version of the paper is also uploaded to the repository. It contains a detailed description of the pipeline and following code in appendix E.
